# Wonder Weeks Project
## What exactly is a Wonder Week?
<p> A Wonder Week is one way to describe intense periods of infant development. There are thought to be peak times when all babies grow quickly and go through stages of advancing their physical and mental growth. And similarly, times when they don’t seem to do much at all.</p>
<p>Fussiness and an increase in separation anxiety can be cues that a baby is about to make a developmental leap. It’s useful for parents to think about what their baby is experiencing during a Wonder Week to best understand why their baby may be a bit more unsettled and clingy.</p>

## When are the Wonder Weeks?
<p>This generally depends on the individual baby. There are all sorts of factors which influence babies’ development. Genetics, environment, gender, prematurity, siblings – the list is endless.
 But on average, give or take a week or two, the following ages are suggested as when Wonder Weeks happen:</p>

+  5 weeks
+  8 weeks
+ 12 weeks
+ 19 weeks
+ 26 weeks
+ 37 weeks
+ 46 weeks
+ 55 weeks
+ 64 weeks
+ 75 weeks

<p> In this project I designed a calculator for the age of the baby in weeks and connecting with a MySql-Wonder Weeks database for the weeks with a mental leap and a short description of the corresponding mental leap.  </p>
